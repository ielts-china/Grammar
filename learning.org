Five Principles On Language Learning

* These points interact with each other:
** Meaning 
** Relevance 
** Attention 
** Memory




* Focus on language content that is relevant to you:
** set and achieve Personal Goals

* Practicality:
** Use the new language as a tool to communicate

* Comprehension:
** When you first understand the message you will acquire the language 

* Physiological training: 
** talking takes muscle
** understanding needs listening,

* Psychological state: 
** happiness learns easier
** be tolerant to ambiguity

Eight actions:


* Listen a lot, bath your brain as much as you can in the new language (paonaozi)
* Focus on getting the meaning first, before the words. Use patterns you know.
* Start mixing (10Vx10Nx10A=1000 Sentences), be creative
* Focus on the core (1000 Words cover 85%, 3000 Words cover 98% in English)
* Get a language parent (works hard to understand you, does not correct you, confirms using correct language, use words you know)
* Copy the face: hear how it feels, feel how it sounds
* Direct Connect to mental images: every word should have an image
* Use a plan
Week 1: Use a tool box (ready-made patterns) in the target language (What is this? How do you say ...?)
Week 2: Pronounce, common verbs, adjectives
Week 3: Glue words (but, althought, however, even though)


Other techniques
** Relax! Make mistakes
** sounds + structure = language database in the brain 
** there is no rule that tells us if we are wrong or right as long as you haven't learned it
** Do not use the foreign alphabet
** use pieces of your own language alphabet
