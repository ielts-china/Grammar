* Reported speech

Used to report someone's words.
The opposite is called "direct speech".

*** Simple Present -> Simple Past

| Direct speech   | Tom says: "I stay at home."      |
|-----------------+----------------------------------|
| Reported speech | Tom said that he stayed at home. |

*** Present Continuous -> Past continuous

| Direct speech   | "I am eating."              |
|-----------------+-----------------------------|
| Reported speech | She told me she was eating. |

*** Simple Present -> Simple Present (still valid!)

| Direct speech   | "I work in Nanning."              |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------|
| Reported speech | He said that he works in Nanning. |

*** Simple Past -> Past perfect

| Direct speech   | "She killed my wife."                 |
|-----------------+---------------------------------------|
| Reported speech | He said that she had killed his wife. |

*** Simple Past continuous -> Past perfect continuous

| Direct speech   | "She was driving my car."                  |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------------|
| Reported speech | He said that she had been driving his car. |

*** Present Perfect -> Past Perfect

| Direct speech   | Sarah tells me: "Tom has always been nice to me." |
| Reported speech | She told me that Tom had always been nice to her. |

*** Past Perfect -> Past Perfect

No changes!

*** can/will -> could/would


* Reported questions

When we report what people say, we usually change the tense of the verbs to reflect that 
we are reporting – not giving direct speech. This pattern is followed when we report questions 
and there are also other important changes between direct questions and reported questions.

** Yes/no questions

*** Direct question: “Do you like working in teams?” 
*** Reported question: He asked if I like working in teams.

When we report yes/no questions we use ‘if’ or ‘whether’.


*** Direct question: “Did you enjoy the party?” 
*** Reported question: She asked me whether I’d enjoyed the party.

The tense of the verb changes as it does in reported speech but we don’t use auxiliary verbs. 
The word order is the same as in an affirmative sentence.


** Questions with a question word

*** Direct question: “What time does the train leave?” 
*** Reported question: He asked what time the train left.

When there is a question word (what, where, why, who, when, how) we use that question word 
in the reported question but there is no auxiliary verb and the word order is like an 
affirmative sentence (‘what time the train left’ not He asked me what time did the train leave.)

Look at some more examples:


*** Direct question: “Who did you see?”
*** Reported question: She asked me who I’d seen.

*** Direct question: “Where did you go to school?”
*** Reported question: He asked me where I’d gone to school.

*** Direct question: “Why are you crying?”
*** Reported question: She asked him why he was crying.

Notice that the reported questions do not have a question mark at the end.


** Questions without question word (whether/if)

*** Direct question: "Do you speak English?"
*** Indirect question: He asked me whether I spoke English.


** Requests

No backshift is needed, simply use "to + infinitive"

*** Direct request: She said: "Say hello to your mum."
*** She asked me to say hello to my mum.

For negative requests, simply use "not to + infinitive"

*** Direct request: She said: "Please don't smoke here."
*** Indirect request: She told me not to smoke there.

Attention when using "Let's"

*** Direct suggestion: "Let's go home!"
*** Indirect form: He suggested going home.
*** Indirect form: He suggested that we should go home.


** Indirect questions

Similar to reported questions are indirect questions.

*** Can you tell me what time the train leaves? 
NOT Can you tell me what time does the train leave?
*** I’d love to know what he said to her. 
NOT I’d love to know what did he say to her.
 


** change of time and place

| direct    | indirect       |
|-----------+----------------|
| here      | there          |
| now       | then           |
| tomorrow  | the next day   |
| yesterday | the day before |
| will      | would          |
| can       | could          |
